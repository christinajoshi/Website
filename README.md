# Website

Basic website to share information about myself and to develop my front-end skills, as the majority of work I've done is back-end. 
Please note: This is very much under construction. Also, I frequently push to Netlify, so can get feedback from friends. 
Here's the link: https://nifty-wiles-a0f292.netlify.app/ 

Until I'm ready for the world to see it:
meta name="robots" content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"

Website currently, consists of:
a. index.html (hello page)
b. about-me.html (basic info regarding schooling, degrees, internships, work experience, and recent tech)
c. Yellowstone.html (Yellowstone National Park) 
d. Notes (this is sloppy, but some of what I've learned thus far)

I would like to include pages for the following: 

a. Places I've traveled and interesting info about
i. the Big Island
ii. Glacier National Park
iii. Yucatan Peninsula (Mayan ruins, etc.)

b. Art and ideas 
i. Museums 
ii. Artists; authors, musicians, etc.
iii. Philosophical
